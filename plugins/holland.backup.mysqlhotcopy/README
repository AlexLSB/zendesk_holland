SYNOPSIS
========

$ holland backup mysqlhotcopy
$ holland mk-config mysqlhotcopy

DESCRIPTION
===========

This plugin does not call the mysqlhotcopy command.  Rather this is a 
reimplementation that provides much of the same functionality.

holland-mysqlhotcopy provides a backup plugin through which raw database 
backups can be made safely.  This plugin issues a table lock and flushes
MySQL tables either via LOCK TABLES ... READ LOCAL followed by an explicit
FLUSH TABLES query, or by issuing a global FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK query.

While this lock is held, the plugin create an archive of the MySQL datadir.

Currently holland-mysqlhotcopy supports multiple archive types:

* tar
* zip (zip64)
* directory

All the archive types support optional compression.
